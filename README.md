# Slotify Frontend

## Project Description
Slotify is a smart parking reservation platform designed to simplify the way you find and book parking. Whether you're heading to work, shopping, or an event, Slotify lets you reserve your parking space in advance, saving you time, reducing stress, and helping you avoid the hassle of circling around.

With just a few clicks, users can view available slots in real-time, choose the most convenient location, and secure their spot instantly. Our mission is to make urban parking effortless by combining intuitive design with reliable, up-to-date information.

Slotify is built with convenience in mind, so your parking is one less thing to worry about.
